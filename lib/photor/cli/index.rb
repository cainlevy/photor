    Recursively searches for all JPEGs, and records metadata useful for future
    searching, tagging, and de-duping.

    All metadata is stored in a SQLite database. This means the db can be archived
    and accessed with the photos, by multiple clients (but not concurrently).

    The database only caches metadata from each photo, to speed up certain
    operations. The photo headers (e.g. EXIF) are still the canonical data source.
